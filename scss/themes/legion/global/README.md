# Railscast Theme

by Jeff Harris


MINIMIZE QUERIES: add any one of the following tags before the beginning of your query (in the same block):

    #min-title = hides the page reference link / page title
    #min-con = hides the contextual reference information (breadcrumbs)
    #minimal = hides both the title and the context
    #min-q = hides the query string, similar to legacy behavior
    #min-all = hides everything â€” title, context, and query string
    #min-todo = hides everything and makes a compact list
