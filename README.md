# Legion theme for Roam Research

Roam Research template designed to emphasize readability and simplicity.

## Attributions

This builds upon the [Roam Mosaic](https://github.com/roam-mosaic/theme-boilerplate) boilerplate and work of [Better Roam Research](https://github.com/linuz90/better-roam-research) theme.  I'm indebted to their efforts.

We're also leveraging the [Lexend](https://github.com/ThomasJockin/lexend) and [Roboto Mono](https://github.com/googlefonts/RobotoMono) fonts to improve the reading experience.  We used [AnyConv](https://anyconv.com/ttf-to-woff2-converter/) to generate WOFF2 files from TTF where needed.
